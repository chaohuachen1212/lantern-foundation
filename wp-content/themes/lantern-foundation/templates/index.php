      <p>Hi! My name is Valerie Li. Besides my work helping improve the lives of kids in poverty, my main passions are community service, human rights, and law and political advocacy. At school, I am the vice president of Key Club, an international community service organization, and president of the Amnesty Club, the largest grassroots human rights organization. I am also a part of my schoolâ€™s debate team and travel every few weekends to compete in national tournaments. Outside of school, I work on projects related to environmental justice and AAPI hate crime prevention. In my free time, I enjoy traveling to new places, hiking and exploring, and spending time with my family.</p>

      <p>My goal for Lantern Foundation is to expand our impact beyond just helping children who experience poverty in China but rather to children all around the world. I hope that my work can help improve the lives of children in many aspects, whether that be providing them with education, allowing them to receive medical care, or creating a joyful childhood that they can reflect positively upon. Put simply, I hope that this organization can help make a difference in the life of a child.</p>

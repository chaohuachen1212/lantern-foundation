          <p>To become a Lantern Ambassador, we encourage you to lead your own initiative in raising donations for our foundation. Whether it be through bake sales or selling handmade crafts, we encourage you to use your own creativity and develop your own project!
Note that the amount you raise does not matter, what matters is the time you spent on leading your own initiative and raising awareness about our cause. However, you will be required to share at least one photo of you and your project.</p>

      <p>We currently have a team of over 70 volunteers and ambassadors! Our volunteers and ambassadors range from elementary school students to college graduates. They support us in a range of activities, whether through fundraising, volunteering at events, placing donation boxes, and so much more!
 
Here are some photos of our volunteers helping out and our ambassadors’ initiatives, including plant-selling, cookie-making, arts and crafts activities, delivering donation boxes, and backpack-packaging.</p>

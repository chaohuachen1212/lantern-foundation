        <p>Hi, I’m Valerie, the founder of Lantern Foundation. My passion for helping children in rural China began with stories from my grandparents about their challenges growing up in rural communities. Their experiences sparked my curiosity and drove me to learn more about this issue.</p>
        <p>In 2018, I attended a charity event hosted by Love Foundation, an organization in Hong Kong that focuses on helping the left-behind children in China. This event deepened my understanding, prompting me to watch countless YouTube videos about kids in rural China, from sources like South China Morning Post, CGTN, and other channels I stumbled upon.</p>
        <p>In ninth grade, while preparing for my AP Chinese exam, I read about Stanford's REAP program researching underserved rural Chinese children. After discovering their website, I read many of their old journal articles and studies about rural China. Combined with my passion for public policy, I started researching about China’s policies and initiatives regarding rural development to understand the main problems that kids in rural areas faced.</p>
        <p>As I learned more about the hardships kids in rural China faced, I also realized that there were very few organizations in the US that addressed this issue. Many people only knew about China because of its tense relationship with the US or because of its economic and technological developments. These realizations inspired me to initiate Lantern Foundation starting in October of 2022</p>
        <p>With Lantern Foundation, I hope to raise awareness about the millions of kids that live in rural China and make a meaningful impact on their lives. Meanwhile, I want to create a community that works alongside me to tackle this issue. I can’t wait to see what we can achieve together!</p>

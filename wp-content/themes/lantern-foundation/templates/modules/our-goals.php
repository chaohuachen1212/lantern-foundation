        <h3>Learn</h3>
        <p>Understand the underlying causes, the main challenges, and potential solutions of rural disparities and poverty. Educate ourselves through speaking with volunteers and experts, reading about government policies, and researching about the underserved kids in rural areas. Only when we understand the problems that kids face can we find effective solutions.</p>

        <h3>Inspire</h3>
        <p>Encourage others to make a difference in addressing the challenges and poverty children in rural areas face. Empower other people to join our efforts, lead their own initiatives, and advocate for our causes. By creating a community that is focused on addressing and solving the same issue, we can amplify our impact and help even more kids.</p>

        <h3>AID</h3>
        <p>Make an impact in the lives of Chinaâ€™s left-behind children and of kids that live in rural areas, all of whom face many obstacles that we may not recognize. Create change with your donations, participation at our events, and continued interest in our work and         campaigns. Even if it is just one kid, we must do all that we can to support them.</p>

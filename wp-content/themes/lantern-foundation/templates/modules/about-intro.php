    <p>Established early 2023, Lantern Foundation is a nonprofit organization dedicated to bettering the lives of children who live in rural China through increasing educational opportunities and expanding medical access. Many kids that live in rural China face various degrees of poverty and challenges due to the under-resourced and underdeveloped infrastructure, which limits their access to opportunities and essential services. Because these kids lack the chances for social improvement, they are often trapped in a cycle of poverty that affects future generations too. Gradually, they lose the belief in the importance of education and the necessity of maintaining strong health.Â </p>
    <p>Because of the limited economic prospects for families in rural China, many parents often travel to big cities like Shanghai or Beijing for work, leaving their children in rural areas under the care of distant relatives or grandparents. These kids are known as left-behind children in China. The lack of parental figures creates damaging effects for the kids. They face worse educational outcomes and experience increased mental health challenges, such as low self-esteem and high levels of anxiety.</p>
    <p>Through donations, events, and campaigns, we want to spark awareness, create an impact, and be a part of the solution for kids in rural China. Since we have launched our foundation, we have achieved many milestones, from being officially recognized as a nonprofit organization to establishing long-term partnerships with international organizations and expanding our volunteer and donor base to creating a tangible impact on the lives of kids in rural China. With your continued support, we vow to continue making a difference</p>

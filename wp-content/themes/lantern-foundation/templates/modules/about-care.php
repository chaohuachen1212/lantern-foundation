    <h2>Why You Should Care</h2>
    <div class="text-wrap">
      <p>Although China has taken some initiative to decrease the poverty rate in recent years, the disparities between rural and urban areas still exist. For example, although the Chinese government provides free education from first grade to sixth grade, the schools in rural areas are severely underfunded with less experienced teachers and lower quality materials. Or, although the government offers public health insurance for everyone, insurance in rural areas covers significantly less treatments and necessities while the health of people in rural areas is statistically worse. These disparities impact kids the most, due to their increased health vulnerability and dependence. A greater percentage of Chinaâ€™s ethnic minorities live in rural areas as well, which causes ethnic minorities to experience a greater proportion of these challenges.</p>
